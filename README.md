## Introduction

* cluster based on emotion, and see which factors are most important to being able to predict emotion
* regression for time vs other factors? maybe do a reverse, like "these behaviors tend to get people to stay on longer"
    * y=time spent

## Data Sources
- Dataset 1: [Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-beinghttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being) - Kaggle dataset tracking dominant emotional state alongside social media user activity.
    - Originally presented as train, test, validation files, which were recombined into `analytics.main.social_media_usage_emotion`.
    - Some manual cleaning was performed prior to combining.
- Dataset 2: [Social_Media_And_Twitter_Mental_Health_Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sayanroy058/Social_Media_And_Twitter_Mental_Health_Dataset) - Broader metrics of mental well-being and demographics including relationship status, age, and occupation.
