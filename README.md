#### Hex
[Hex](https://hex.tech/) is required for data visualizations and additional analysis. Other Hex features are optional.

**Learning Resources:**
- [Resource 1]
- [Resource 2]
- [Resource 3]

### Step 2: Kickstart Your Project

To give you a starting point (though entirely optional):
- Your MotherDuck account includes two pre-loaded social media datasets: `data_set_1` and `data_set_2`.
- Your Paradime account links to a GitHub repository with pre-configured dbt‚Ñ¢ models, which reference the pre-loaded social media data sets in MotherDuck. 

*Important:* These resources are provided merely as a convenience. You are not required to use them in your project. In fact, to excel in this challenge, you must incorporate additional datasets beyond these initial offerings. Here's what you need to know:

1. The pre-loaded datasets and models are optional tools ‚Äì use them if they benefit your analysis, or disregard them completely if they don't fit your chosen direction.
2. Regardless of whether you use the provided resources, you are required to bring in and analyze additional datasets as part of your submission.
3. Your project should demonstrate your ability to work with diverse data sources and create insightful models beyond any pre-configured setups.

Remember, the most impactful submissions often come from participants who think outside the box and bring fresh data and perspectives to their analysis. We're excited to see how you'll leverage various data sources to uncover unique insights!

### Step 3: Generate Insights
Use Paradime, MotherDuck, and Hex to uncover compelling insights from social media data. Aim for accurate, relevant, and engaging discoveries.

#### Potential Insight Ideas

Your primary goal is to use Paradime, MotherDuck, and Hex to unearth compelling insights from social media data. With so many social media platforms, chat forums, and supplementary datasets, the possibilities for discovery are virtually limitless. Aim to generate accurate, relevant, scroll-stopping insights. Here are some ideas:

- **COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Analysis Question:** How has the sentiment around COVID-19 on Reddit changed over time? Why?
   - **Required Social Media Data**: [Reddit posts and comments related to COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/the-reddit-covid-dataset), or similar dataset.
   - **Optional/Supplementary Data**: Key dates, news, events, and/or anything that points to why sentiment has changed over time.

- **Donald Trump Popularity Trends**
   - **Analysis Question:** How has Donald Trump's popularity changed over time?
   - **Required Social Media Data**: A sample of Twitter posts, mentions, and engagement, containing the words "Donald Trump" over the last 10 years.
   - **Optional/Supplementary Data**: Key dates, news, events, and/or anything that points to why popularity has changed over time.

- **Top YouTube Creators Study**
   - **Analysis Question:** Who are the biggest YouTube creators, and why?
   - **Required Social Media Data**: YouTube comments, engagement metrics, etc.
   - **Optional/Supplementary Data**: [Trending YouTube Video statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=CAvideos.csv), or similar datasets.

- **2022 NFL Superbowl Commercial Impact**
   - **Analysis Question:** Which Commercials were most popular during the 2022 NFL Superbowl?
   - **Required Social Media Data**: Twitter and/or Reddit posts, mentions, and engagement during the 4-hour time block of the NFL Superbowl. Only pull data that contains information about [brands that had Superbowl commercials](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/super-bowl-commercials-2022).
   - **Optional/Supplementary Data**:
     - For public companies that advertised, pull stock market data to see if there's any correlation between Superbowl commercial success and stock price.
     - Using [Superbowl advertisement cost data](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/how-much-does-the-average-super-bowl-commercial-cost), identify which brands had the highest social engagement per dollar spent.
