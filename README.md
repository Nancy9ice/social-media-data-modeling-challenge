## Building Your Project

Now that you're set up, you have until **September 2nd, 2024** to submit your project!

### Step 1: Get familiar with the required Platforms:

#### Paradime:
You're required to utilize Paradime for SQL and dbt™ development. Get familar with the platform using these resources:
- **Code IDE UI:** Follow our [interactive tutorial](https://app.arcade.software/share/7kRyaYbPoGc5ofmJfmvY)
- **Commands Panel:** Learn how to use the Integrated Terminal, Data Explorer, Data Lineage, and Data Catalog with our [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQtIn-tnnbg).  
- **DinoAI Copilot** - Discover how DinoAI improves your SQL and dbt development through our [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiosgQFsuk). 
- **Paradime Help Docs**: For a comprehensive understanding of all the features and how to make the most of Paradime for your project, explore the [Paradime Help Docs](https://docs.paradime.io/app-help).
- **MotherDuck**:
- **Hex**: 

### Step 2: Kickstart your project:
Your MotherDuck account comes pre-loaded with two social media datasets: data_set_1 and data_set_2. Additionally, your Paradime account is connected to a GitHub repository with pre-configured dbt™ models to get you started.
These datasets are simply a starting point. While you're welcome to use them to generate insights, you'll need to incorporate additional datasets to truly excel in this challenge.

### Step 3: Generating Insights
Your primary goal is to use Paradime, MotherDuck, and Hex to unearth compelling insights from social media data. With so many social media platforms, chat forums, and supplementary datasets, the possibilities for discovery are virtually limitless. 
Aim to generate accurate, relavant, scroll-stopping insights.
